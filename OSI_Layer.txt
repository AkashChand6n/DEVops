1.Client-Server Model

    The Client-Server Model is a network architecture in which one device (the client) requests services or resources, and another device (the server) provides those services or resources.
    Client	-   device that requests resources
    Server  -   device that provides resources

2.OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)

Physical Layer (Layer 1)
    Responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices
    Specifies the physical medium, signaling methods, and hardware interfaces.
    Physical layer contains information in the form of bits                         //bits

Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
    Responsible for node-to-node data transfer
    error detection/correction
    Flow Control
    Organizes data into frames                                                      //frames

Network Layer (Layer 3)
    Routing of data packets between devices
    The best route for delivery
    Segment in the Network layer is referred to as Packet                           //Packet

Transport Layer (Layer 4)
    Ensures data is correctly ordered and reassembled.
    The transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission and re-transmits the data if an error is found.

    TCP - Connection-Oriented Service
    UDP - Connection-less Service

Session Layer (Layer 5)
    Responsible for connections(Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination)
    
    Dialog Controller
        The session layer allows two systems to start communication with each other in half-duplex or full-duplex

Presentation Layer (layer 6)
    Formatting
    encryption
        process used to secure data by converting it from its original, readable form into an unreadable format using an algorithm and a key

Application Layer   (Layer 7)
    This layer interacts directly with application software
