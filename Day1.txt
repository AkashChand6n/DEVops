OSI model 
this is a conceptual thing


1.Physical layer
    connection which is physical 

2.Datalink layer
    node to node transfer
    error corrections

3.Network layer
    Routing 
    Ip addressing 
    The best route for delivery.It also handles the routing of packets across networking

4.Transport layer
    Data delivery 
    order of the data 

5.Session layer
    manages the connnection

6.Presentation layer
    encryption and formatting

7.Application layer
    Create data



1.Client and Server Model
2.OSI model 
3.encoding
4.encryption
5.tcp/ip
6.icmp
7.ARP
8.IGMP
9.NIC
10.Submarine Cable
11.Fiber-optic cable
12.nodes/Hosts/Client and servers/Protocol
13.LAN/MAN/WAN
14.Modem vs router
    modem-  Convert digital signal to analoge and viceversa
            conncet to the ISP
            Minimal security

    router- Routes data packet btw devices in a network
            Connect to a modem and distribute the internet
            Have firewall and security

15.scalablity and elasticity
    vertical - scale up/down
    horizontal - scale in/out
    
    Load balancer
    service dicovery

    Application Stateless

16.NW technology
    Bus     -   Single connection   
    Ring    -   circular path
    Tree    -   
    Mesh    -   Everything is connected to each other

17. peer to peer

18.Socket and ports
    Sockets - Combination of ip and port    
    Port    -

19.HTTP
    Method 
        GET     - Retrieve Data (There won't be any json)
        POST    - Create Data   (json format)
        PUT     - Update Data   (json format)
        DELETE  - Remove Data
