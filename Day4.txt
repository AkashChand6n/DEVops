1.Data centers
    can be used to store and processing

    key components of data center
        server - processing
        storage system - storage devices
        network instances - network devices
        power infr - power distribution
        cooling system - manintain temp
        security system - protection of the data

    types of data center
        On-premise DC
            owned by the operation
            they are complete control
        
        colocation data center
            lease space in a data center facility
        
        cloud data center
            provide various cloud service
                IaaS
                PaaS
                Saas
            operation is done by the provider
            they are large scale data center

    key consideration for data center design and operation
        Reliablity
            Ensuring high Avilablity trough redundancy and fault tolerance

        security
            protection of data and infrastructure

        scalablity
            designing the data center to accommodate future growth
        
        energy efficiency
            optimizing power usage to reduce

        Disaster Recovery
            recovery from Disaster

2.NAS/DAS/SAN
    NAS - network access storage
            file level access
            network file system(nfs)

    DAS - direct access storage
            devices specific access

    SAN - storage area network
            block level access

3.RAID
    RAID 0
    RAID 1
    RAID 5
    RAID 6
    RAID 10(1+0)
        combines mirroring and striping

4.backup and recovery
    backup - Create copy  of the data
    recovery - restoring from the backup
    recovery time objective(rto) - target time to which a system or application must be restored after an outage
    recovery point objective(rpo) - max amount if data loss that a organization can tolerate

    types of backup
        Full backup
        incremental backup
        diffrential backup

    backup stratagies
        3-2-1 stratagies
            one would be of-site
            two diffrent media types
            three copy
    
5.packet filtering firewall
  
  stateful inspection firewall

  application level gateway(proxy firewall)

  next generation firewall

6.common network security threat
    Malware
    phishing attack
    DOS attack
    man-in-the-middle
    SQL injection

7.Why load balancing is importance

    Common load balancing technique
        round robin
        least connection
        least response time
        source ip hashing
        weighted round robin

    type of load balancer
        hardware load balancer
        software load balancer

    benefits of load balancer
        improved performance
        enhanced Reliablity
        increased scalablity
        cost efficiency
    
    choosing the right load balancer
