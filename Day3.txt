//Static NAT
    static ip address
//Dynamic NAT
    ip is Dynamic
//microservices
    Load balancer
    not an in memory call
    divided based on the funcionality
    here we could grow
    microservices bring some new problems 
//NAT table
    this has a to and from address
    when leaving the private add 
    port also used 
    the public add would be unique
//0.0.0.0/0
    /0 subnet mask
    all the ip address in the world
    this could be 2^32
    Hosts are represented as 0.0.0.0/0
    //loop back devices
//VPC
//queue/publisher


1.Stateless and stateful firewall
    stateful - remember the connection
    Stateless - doesn't remember the connection (considered as a new connection)

2.Gateway 
    ensure only way to come in
    increase the security
    microservices are not directly connected

3.PAT(personal access token)
    instead of giving userid and password you can share PAT

4.server farm
    collection of physical server that work together to delivey service
    people don't need dedicate devices
    scalible and reliable

5.Ipsec
    secure ip communication trough encryption and Authentication
    SA define the encryption algorithm,lifetime of the connection and Authentication method 

6.firewall
    ingress
    ex
    work in network Layer

7.treat,vulnerablity and risk
    vulnerablity - A weakness in a system
    treat - a potentional danger
    risk -the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerablity and the potentional inpact of that  exploitation

8.Reversed proxy
    reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices (such as web browsers) and a web server (or multiple web servers). 
    It acts as an intermediary that handles incoming requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate backend server. 
    Once the backend server processes the request, the reverse proxy sends the response back to the client.

9.Ipv4 and Ipv6
     Ipv4-  32 bit
            dotted decimal
            manual or DHCP for address config



     Ipv6-  128 bit
            Hexadecimal
            manual,slaac and DHCPV6

10.3 way handshake
    ISN number which is randomly Created
    sync, sync- ack, ack

11. IEEE 802.11 (wifi)

12.DHCP

13.switch and router

14.port forwarding

15.Hub and switch
    Hub -   work at the physical layer
            can listen to all the msg connected to this
    switch - virtual network is Created
             is full duplex

16.VLAN - virtual lan 

17.port mapping
    also known as port forwarding
    technique used to allow traffic from the internet to access service or devices on a private network

18.cidr and subnet

19.switch/hub/gateway/bridge/router
    Gateway - help to connect two diffrent network
    bridge - connect network segments
